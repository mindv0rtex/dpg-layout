# Introduction

This project is an experiment in understanding the constraint-based layout logic implemented in the [Enaml](https://github.com/nucleic/enaml) GUI framework, and porting it to the stand-alone C++ library. Like Enaml, it relies on the [Kiwi](https://github.com/nucleic/kiwi) constraint solver. If successful, the intention is to use this code in the [DearPyGui](https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui) framework.
